                <b>Hidden Features:</b>
                <p>Crafty is designed foremost as an object viewer, but it also contains several useful features that
                  can be invoked externally. For example, Crafty's File System Browser, Material Browser and Model
                  Browser can all be invoked with special command arguments. To view one or more packages in File System
                  Browser simply use: <i>Crafty.exe -fsb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... </i>. To view one or
                  more packages in Material Browser simply use: <i>Crafty.exe -msb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2]
                    ... </i>. To view one or more packages in Model Browser simply use: <i>Crafty.exe -mb -mount
                    [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... </i>. For example, if you wanted to view thumbnails of the
                  materials in <i>source materials.gcf</i> you would use <i>Crafty.exe -msb -mount "source
                    materials.gcf"</i>. If you are familiar with Windows you can also add shortcuts to these features in
                  the system context menu.</p>

                Next question:<br>
                <br>
                I am trying to create some cinematics for a cut sequence of my level. To get the same 'look' as in game
                I have altred vrad to output the lightmaps as tga files. I have exported the set as obj from crafty
                (hammer dxf does not have texture param). However, the parameterization of the surfaces that come out of
                craft don't match to the lightmaps, and there is only one texture coordinate set. Any ideas on how to
                get the lightmap coordinates?<br>

                <br>
                I've also almost completed v2.0.0 of HLLib (the library that opens GCF files) so the File System Browser
                will see a big face lift to it's internals in the next few weeks.</div>

                <br>
                Percicely. Like I said, I've got the light maps. I'll see if I can't hook the guy up on the link with
                how to get them to export from vrad.<br>
                <br>
                So if you can put that feature in it would be *very* helpful. It's the last piece that will allow is to
                create a compleatly ingame look in a 3d package. <br>
                <br>
                Alternatly, you might could give me a hent as to were in one of the valve mod kit apps I might just find
                the reading or writing of the lightmap UV set (or a procedure that computes them). And I could handle
                the rest myself. <br>
                <br>
                I'll start looking myself, but so far I haven't see anything obvious.<br>
                <br>

              <div class="content">Exporting the lightmaps and the lightmap UVs as a separate mesh isn't to troublesome
                (that is to say, the way the code is, exporting the lightmaps can be done in a line or two), the reason
                the next release is going to take about two weeks is because I'm converting it over to HLLib v2.0.0 and
                I have still to implement the .map &lt;-&gt; .vmf conversion I promised someone else.<br>
                <br>
                HLLib v2.0.0 is sitting at a healthy 8000+ lines and is just undergoing some final tweaking, and
                GCFScape v1.5.0 is ready (minus the validation feature I added to HLLib v2.0.0). But as you can imagine
                all these things take up a lot of my spare time and I have to prioritize feature requests.<br>
                <br>
                I'll try to lookup the formulas for the UVs this weekend and post them (they weren't anywhere obvious in
                the source code, I had to figure them out for myself).</div>

              <div class="content">As long as we're on the subject. It would also be very nice if you could preserve the
                materials assignments. In the obj file, I get a few objects, one of which is the entire bsp model, the
                others are trigger zones that I don't need. However, when I break it apart every single poly is
                seperate, and they all have the same material. To rebuild I'm manually going through grouping, and
                assigning materals based on the same bsp loaded in hammer (good thing I have two monitors). It sure
                would save a good deal of time if I could have the materal assignments.<br>

                <br />
                I tried it ingame from many angles, but nothing appeared.<br />
                <br />
                Also, i noticed that Half-Life .mdl is not working correctly in Crafty at the moment, you should make a
                note about that for people who are trying it at this moment, even if it still alpha. <img

                <br />
                EDIT: Another thing you should fix, is that you can't see any face of the map from outside of it. This
                makes me sometimes reload the map because i lose the sight of where the map is.<br />

                between how Crafty and HL render BSP files, but I'll try to sort it out.<br /><br />MDL files do *work*,
                they just lack animations which causes models with animations to appear all jumbled. Animations will be
                added for the final release.<br /><br />If you venture outside the world, you can get the whole world to
                draw by disabling <i>Occlusion Culling</i> (<i>Rendering</i> menu). You can also reset the camera to its

              <div class="content">Great tool, however... I found a little bug!<br />
                On the de_dust2 map from CS 1.6 it seems like when i move the camera (movement, not rotation) it
                suddenly jumps from the current position to like -14723894729834.<br />
                But it seems like it started happening after i applied the textures (mounted a folder with the .wad
                files in the FSB).<br />
                It doesn't occur on other maps I've tested, so I'm kinda out of ideas.<br />
                Any thoughts?</div>

                loop in .NET so the keyboard input is kind of a hack (I'll try to revisit it). Does this continuously
                happen or is it only once per load? In the mean time, you can reset the camera from the view menu when
                it happens, though I have to say I've never experienced it.</div>

                And tap it back to the previous location, so it's like if the camera was inside somekind of box.<br />

              <div class="content">Hey great program. I'm just trying to find out the codes for any maps I don't know
                yet and I'm not really sure how to go about doing that, I tried a couple of these bsp things - not sure
                if the map I'm using doesn't decompile correctly or whatever but I can't find anything even close to a
                code (like on a keypad that opens a door etc) how can one go about doing this? thanks for any advice and

                from trial and error of millions of combinations, decompiling(?) may be the only way to find the codes
                as the maps are older and/or it is very rare to find someone who might know it. seems like it woulda
                been easier than this :) click on an object and see it's associations etc- but nothing so far. the codes
                are almost always a sequence of numbers (1-9) or letters. maybe the rarer maps I'm looking for didn't
                decompile correctly or something. Would this be a hard thing to do ? o.O thanks for the advice :)</div>

                at first I'd like to thank you for this awesome tool! It's very handy.<br />
                <br />
                But I got a problem:<br />
                Every time I load a model from outside any GFCs, the appropriate textures are missing. This happens -
                for example - with Fakefactory's Cinematic Mod, where some new high poly character models are used with
                also new high resolution textures. All the models can be opened, but I still haven't found a way to
                display them textured.<br />
                <br />
                Any suggestions?<br />

              <div class="content">Dunno what to say, I've tried a bunch of maps and they all work fine for
                me.<br /><br />If your importer only works some of the time (seemingly randomly) it's a good indication
                that there might be something wrong with your importer.<br /><br />BSP normals are not exported (3DS Max
                should calculate these) and model normals should be fine as long as <i>Unify</i> isn't checked. Object
                Viewer and Model Viewer use the same export code, so if you get different results it sounds like a
                problem with your importer.<br /><br />The rotation should be fixed if <i>Rotate Model</i> isn't
                checked, but it's hard to know what your importer will do because OBJ files do not specify the
                &quot;up&quot; vector, and it is different for different modeling packages.<br /><br />Maybe try
                searching for another 3DS Max OBJ importer on the net? There is also a good program out there called <a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917095433/http://mysite.verizon.net/sfg0000/">PoseRay</a> which
                can import Crafty OBJ files fine, view them, transform them (swap Y and Z to change the up vector etc.)
                for different modeling packages and export them.</div>

                3Ds Max 9 (for a little project) and I can get the object to import just fine, but the textures are not
                preserved... If i import the .mtl list I still do not get the textures with the files loaded... just
                default grey... Which means i have to go through by hand and add the .tgas to the textures 1 at a time
                which is a slight pain in the arse... Is this just the way it is? Or am I doing something wrong??<br />
