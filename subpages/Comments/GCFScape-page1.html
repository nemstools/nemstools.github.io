								GCF files are quite complex and while enough is known about them to be able to extract them there is not
								enough known to be able to modify them. This would probably require some documentation from Valve.<br>

								some time today and i came across something that might peak your interest. I ran <a

									TextScan</a> on steam.exe and among the long stream of nothingness that came out was a version number
								and copyright info ( here it is: deflate 1.1.4 Copyright 1995-2002 Jean-loup Gailly ). wondering what
								steam was doing with non-valve software i did a quick google search <a
									href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170915121709/http://icarus.as.arizona.edu/~akoski/ghostscript/gs7.04/zlib-1.1.4/">and

								neither have the time or the expertise to flush out its connection to steam, i was hopeing that it might
								become useful to your research on the .gcf format. good luck and keep up the great work nem.<br>

								talking about how they had HL2 and blah blah blah. This got my attion because from what I understand is
								this game will not be relased untill NOV 16th. I talked to them and they said to use a prog called
								GCFScape and get the files out of steam. I did all of this and downloaded all of the files that I had to
								from here but I can not figuar out how to play HL2 now. Is that what this is for or am I just hopelessly

								A lot of people seem to think GCFScape can somehow be used to crack Half-Life 2 so let me clear up these
								misconceptions. First off, Half-Life 2 preloads (and any other games you have not paid for or have not
								been released) and in encrypted form. To confirm this right click on a file and select its properties
								and GCFScape will happily tell you whether or not it is encrypted. GCFScape will extract these encrypted
								files, but they will be of no use to you. Secondly the Half-Life 2 preload does not contain all
								Half-Life 2 files, just bulky things like media, models and levels.<br />
								<br />
								GCFScape was designed to allow legitimate developers to access files they need to develop with, nothing
								more.<br />

								to hold all of the data that the header claims it does. In other words, your .gcf file may be truncated
								or otherwise corrupt. A quick check would be to look at its size. My counter-strike.gcf file is 265.11
								MB, how big is yours?<br />
								<br />
								If you believe this to be false and your .gcf file to be valid, please send it to me so I can take a
