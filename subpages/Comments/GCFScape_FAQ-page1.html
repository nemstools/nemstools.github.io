                            data, file fragments, checksums and other minor features. GCF files are the backbone of

                          <p>GCFScape uses a technique called file mapping to directly access data in a GCF file as you
                            would data in memory. This is a useful technique because it means GCFScape doesn't have to
                            read tons of data into memory to read a GCF file and it can read a GCF file without having
                            to seek all over the place.</p>
                          <p>Because Steam opens GCF files in read/write mode and is liable to change the contents of
                            any GCF file at any time, GCFScape requires that you close Steam. If Steam was open and it
                            changed the contents of a GCF file while it was mapped, GCFScape would become unstable and
                            likely crash.</p>

                An unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will

                It's another fun bug with the FolderBrowserDialog (a bug that currently has no fix). In v1.1 of the .NET
                framework, if the thread apartment is not in STA mode, the FolderBrowserDialog will display only without
                a directory tree to select a folder from. This confused a lot of developers so in v1.1 SP 1 and v2.0
                Beta an exception is thrown instead (which makes it nice and difficult for us developers to manage
                because it is not consistent).<br />
                <br />
                This all stems from the fact that you can't set the apartment state in a C++ .NET application (for
                complex reasons).<br />
                <br />
                The next version of GCFScape will contain a workaround: if GCFScape detects that you are in STA mode the
                FolderBrowserDialog will be displayed, otherwise a dialog that lets you type in the folder will be
                displayed. The next version is actually complete, just awaiting the next HLLib for release.<br />

                <br />
                I installed GCFscape and also installed the .NET crap from dotnetfx.exe, which I DLed from microsoft's
                website. however, everytime i start GCFscape, I get an error message as follows:<br />
                <br />
                &quot;This application failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling
                the application might fix this problem&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Well I headed over to your GCFscape FAQ and it told me to install &gt;NET framework, which I already
                had. So I reinstalled it just to make sure and got the same error message. What am i doing wrong?<br />

              <div class="content">Hi Nem. Dont really get GCFScape and im not entirley sure if it can be used for the
                use I want it to. Basically, I need a program of some sort (I got told by someone that GCFScape does the
                job) that can decompile .BSP map files into .VMF Files, which can be seen and edited in hammer. If
                GCFScape can be used to do this, can you please tell me how, and if not, could any body please tell me a
                program which does do the things I need. Thank you very much in advance<br />

                was run OR on the other computer you extracted the contents of the GCF files. So if you have not done so
                yes, extract the needed resources from your GCF files and mod away.<br />
                <br />
                The stuff you looking for is probably going to be in the 'source materials.gcf' or 'source models.gcf'.
                Though I admit that the file names and contents may have changed since I last poked around in the
                SteamApps folder.</div>

                I want to change the music in Half Life 2 with my own music, is that possible, like FAKEFACTORY did with
                his cinematic mod.<br />
                If it is, do i have to swap some maps in one of the games gfc?, I've read in some other forums that
                you'll have to rename and create new maps and put the music in the new maps, but honestly, I didn't
                understand a shit about what they were talking about &gt;.&lt; So you're my last hope, sort of. .

                <br />
                However i have a problem i can't find a solution for.<br />
                I'd like to get the companion cube from portal and add it to a dystopia map (as an easter egg)(dystopia
                is a source mod).<br />
                <br />
                i extracted the model files from: <br />
                root/portal/models/props<br />
                and added them to:<br />
                \Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\dystopia_v1\models\props<br />
                <br />
                I did the same with the textures from:<br />
                root/portal/materials/models/props<br />
                to:<br />
                \Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\dystopia_v1\materials\models\props <br />
                <br />
                as soon as i restarted source SDK and hammer i could select the box but none of the textures.<br />
                <br />
                did i do something wrong? Or does the model file look for the texture in a path set in the file itself?
                if yes is there a way to find out or to change the dir?<br />

                <br />You don't need GCFScape to open the sound files, they are on your hard drive. (Look in
                <i>...\Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead\left4dead\sound</i>.)<br /><br />What you do need GCFScape for
                is to open <i>...\Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead\left4dead\pak01_dir.vpk</i> which contains
                materials and models.
