                Thanks for testing it. Now all I have to do is figure out a way to combine the code for the next release
                (the workaround is less memory efficient). It will probably be in the form a command line switch.<br />

                <br />
                As much as I disagree with some of Valve's copyright protection schemes there will be no talk of that
                sort of thing here. There is also virtually no chance that GCFScape will ever modify a GCF file. See the
                FAQ.<br />

                Anyways, I am quite sure part of Valve's Steam plane was to create a GCF authoring suit for MOD
                developers so they could distribute their MODs over Steam. This could be a manifestation of this, but I
                don't think it is legitimate (possibly, as you said, a remnant of the Source leek).<br />

                Valve. GCFs are only useful when you have the mod hosted on the Steam servers to fill them up and that
                could far more securely be done internally. :-)</div>

              <div class="content">True, but it will be interesting to see what happens to the major MODs that emerge.
                Given how much the MOD community helped develop Half-Life into what it was, it would seem logical for
                Valve to host major MODs on their servers, both publicizing them and easing bandwidth constraints. If
                people are willing to buy Half-Life 2 for a specific MOD then why not? It is in their interest.</div>

                probably intentional but when you just barely move a folder in the left window pain or the
                &quot;explorer&quot; window it will throw all the files within that folder into a temp directory in the
                gcfscape folder. The reason I have an issue with it is because when I'm in a hurry and clicking on
                folders, I usually end up unknowingly moving the folder a little bit and it extracts them. I find this
                to be really annoying. I guess I could just be really careful with it but I really don't see why it does
                that.</div>

                You'll know if you don't have the .NET framework because you'll get an error when you try to run
                GCFScape.<br /><br />If you mean where are the texture files, they have the .vtf extension and are
                located in your <i>source materials.gcf</i> file.</div>

                Should I copy or recreate the entire folder, ..in this case DE-Nuke and it's contents, or just the vtf,

                They're not showing up in the &quot;metal&quot; material folder when I try just the specific

                <br />
                I'd make the materials from scratch,...but I can't get that damn TGA to vtex prog. conversion to work

                OH!,...and mapping used to be easier,...but I already said that.<img

              </div>
              <div class="content">Ok, well, you've probably noticed in the .gcf file that each material has both a .vtf
                and a .vmt file. You need both to use the material. If you look at say metalbar001a.vmt (in notepad) it
                will look like:<br />
                <br />
                &quot;LightmappedGeneric&quot;<br />
                {<br />
                // Original shader: BaseTimesLightmapAlphaBlend<br />
                &quot;$translucent&quot; 1<br />
                &quot;$basetexture&quot; &quot;Metal/metalbar001a&quot;<br />
                &quot;$surfaceprop&quot; &quot;metal&quot;<br />
                &quot;%compilepassbullets&quot; 1<br />
                &quot;%keywords&quot; &quot;c17downtown,c17industrial,c17sewers,wasteland&quot;<br />
                }<br />
                <br />
                In this case, the $basetexture tells the engine where to find the .vtf file, specifically the .vtf is in
                the metal folder and called metalbar001a.vtf (the extension is omitted since all textures are .vtf files
                and the metal folder is relative to the materials folder (cstrike/materials). So, it follows, if you
                want to use the same material in DOD, you would have to copy both the .vmt and .vtf to the
                dod/materials/metal folder. If you do not (say you choose the dod/materials/custom folder) you will have
                to change the $basetexture to read custom/metalbar001a.<br />
                <br />
                It is important also to distinguish between materials and textures; materials reference textures and
                provide properties used to render them, textures are simply image data.</div>

              <div class="content">Ummm,..yeah,.....I figured that was probably the case.<br />I can ceratinly
                understand why,...and how,......but everything related to mapping has gotten so much......... slower<img
                  src="../../images/emotes/sad.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="sad" />,.......it's just annoying.
                <br /><br />UPDATE,.........90 minutes
                later.<br /><br />OK,...that was a really slow and tedius trial and error process before the material
                finally showed up in Hammer. <br />BTW,...this is all in an effort to <b>re-release</b> a map originally
                created for the old HL engine.<br />
                <br />
                I still appreciate the help, and the time you put into making it any easier at all.<br />
                Thanks again.</div>

                Any tutorials on the folder / file structure for map preperation for distribution? <img

                which embeds the content in your .bsp. I'm not sure if the bug where embedded models wouldn't work has
                been fixed though (with the Source engine, not the tool).<br />
                <br />
                As for where everything goes, its best just to examine the structure of an existing MOD (though
                GCFScape). More less, materials and textures go in the materials folder and models go in the models
                folder (though their materials go in the materials folder). Everything should be in a subfolder, i.e.
                you should never have &quot;materials/mymaterial.vmt&quot;, instead,
                &quot;materials/myfolder/mymaterial.vmt&quot;.</div>
