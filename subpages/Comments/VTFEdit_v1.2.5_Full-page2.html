                but still preserving the mipmap data (in the .dds files) instead of having VTFEdit rebuild or clear them
                completely when you uncheck the &quot;generate mipmaps&quot; box.<br />
                <br />
                I saw an old program that can do a dds to VTF conversion that keeps the dds mipmap data, however it
                cannot do multiple frames animated texture like VTFedit.</div>

                Probably the image is bigger then 120kb, you should make it smaller, or make it have less layers,
                because source doesn't allow sprays over 120 kb

              <div class="content">Hello.Can someone( Nem?) tell me what is the difference between BGR888 and
                BGR888_Bluescreen? and also why is VTF Edit using this function : nvDXTcompress() when I choose the
                BGR888 uncompressed format?<br />
                <br />
                Another thing that I would like to know, is if the memory leak problem was solved.I read about it some
                posts before.<br />
                Look:<br />
                <br />
                &quot;I just waned to note that it seams there are memory leaks within VtfEdit.<br />
                <br />
                After quite a research it turned out the source is not the VTFEdit itself, but the VTFLib that it
                uses.<br />
                After one more day in looking into the source code I found out that the NVIDIA TEXTURE TOOLS Library,
                used by VTFLib for some of its functions, is causing the problem.<br />
                <br />
                Here are my notes:<br />
                <br />
                Importing Image with resulution 4096^4096 few times:<br />
                <br />
                DXT Compression - ok (not 100% sure)<br />
                thumbnail generation - minor LEAKs (~10MB for that image res!)<br />
                mipmap generation - minor LEAKs (another ~10MB)<br />
                resizing 3000 to 4096,- big LEAK (&gt;70MB)<br />
                normalmaps generation - major LEAK (&gt;200MB, 50MB for 2048x2048 image)<br />
                <br />
                NOTE that if you NOT use these functions everythings works great - after importing the same file again
                the memory usage (in task manager) returns to the same value before importing the same image as already
                imported)<br />
                NOTE also that for smaller images the leaks are smaller but are thare!<br />
                <br />
                You can try all this yourself.<br />
                <br />
                Im looking for good texture manipulation library myself, that is why I have done such an
                investigation:)<br />
                <br />
                Comments (on the issue) and directions (for the lib) are welcome!&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Thanks in advance.</div>

              <div class="content">Thanks for the info Zerg. The version of the NVIDIA library I'm using is really old.
                I haven't updated it because they keep reworking the interface (which is quite annoying). If I ever get
                some spare time I might look at it, but to be honest, I have very little spare time these days (just
                look how long it took me to respond).<br />
                <br />
                I'm pretty sure the BGR888_Bluescreen format is used by Valve as a temporary intermittent format when
                converting WADs (which have a single color that acts as transparency (typically blue)).<br />
                <br />
                As for nvDXTcompress, it's just a poorly named function which handles all image data manipulation in
                NVIDIA's library. VTFLib uses it to generate mipmaps amongst other things.<br />
                <br />
                If you're asking me whether you should use NVIDIA's library, the only thing I would consider using it
                for again is DXT compression.</div>

                So heres my Objective. I'm working on a rats map and I'm at that stage where I need my own textures for
                things like books, cd players, games and so on. I want to be able to take the pictures I have taken with
                the camera and place them in my map.<br />
                <br />
                Heres the instructions I Have fallowed and I still cannot get it to work. <br />

                &quot;this is assuming that you have VTFedit. If you don't...google it and get it.<br />
                <br />
                Steam must be on.<br />
                <br />
                Make a folder in your mods material folder.<br />
                Steam\steamapps\email\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials<br />
                <br />
                Name the folder whatever you want.<br />
                Steam\steamapps\email\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\whatever<br />
                <br />
                Make another folder in your mod's sourcesdk_content folder.<br />
                Steam\steamapps\email\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\materialsrc\whatever<br />
                <br />
                Now open VTFedit.<br />
                Go File<br />
                Import your texture<br />
                Press OK<br />
                Once your texture is loaded, go to File<br />
                Save As...<br />
                <br />
                Save the texture into the folder for your mod.<br />
                Steam\steamapps\email\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\whatever\texture_name<br />
                <br />
                Now restart Steam.<br />
                Open Hammer<br />
                Browse to the name of your texture.<br />
                It should be there and ready to use.&quot;</div>

                and it also wouldn't hurt to be able to save your own custom templates too</div>

              <div class="content">Hi, I'm trying to do what a few users above me has already asked about: Importing
                multiple .dds files to make an animated squence of frames, but keep the existing mipmap information.
                (Not create new mipmaps or clear them).<br />
                <br />
                Has anyone found a way to do this? I know it's possible to make .vtf files with a single frame and
                keeping the mipmap info, as another program (Quick and dirty Bloodlines Tools version 3.9a) can do
                this.<br />
                <br />
                Edit: Or alternatively, is there any way to combine a few .vtf files I made in the other program into a
                single animated .vtf file?</div>

                <br />
                I'm trying to make an animated vtf using jpegs.<br />
                I have one problem though, VTFEdit is not accepting different sizes.<br />
                <br />
                Is there a way around this or something? Without having to resize every image, that is...<br />
                <br />
                I also have a GIF of it, if it has any help.<br />

                anyone know how to get around this. I get the default skin for a sawed off shottie in csgo. i open it up
                in photoshop and there are two materials. it turns out the top will receive glossy and through an alpha
                on the top the under wont. they are essentially identical, however once i've unpacked the textures i can
                only save to tga and then bring into vtf. since tga doesn't support layers. i only get the one layer
                most top. how do I repack after editing both materials?<img
